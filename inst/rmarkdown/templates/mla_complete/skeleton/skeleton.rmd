Bundling together templates and common defaults, the `rmd4mla` package is designed to make it easy to use R Markdown for preparing MLA-formatted documents. The YAML header of this document shows most of the options available to be set, though some of them work better than others. Before knitting a document, save it in a folder dedicated to your project.

# Dependencies
To use this package, you'll need a few things installed and working on your computer ahead of time. First, you'll need a working installation of `R`---which probably goes without saying, if you're contemplating writing with R Markdown. In addition to `R` and the recommended R Studio, you'll need at least six associated packages: `rmarkdown`, `knitr`, `tibble`, `dplyr`, and either `remotes` or `devtools` for installing `rmd4mla` from GitHub.

In addition to `R`, you'll need to have a working setup of `Latex`, and it'll probably need to be more full-featured than `TinyTex`. Find something that includes `tex4ht`, `make4ht`, `biblatex`, and [`biblatex-mla`](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-mla?lang=en). I developed and tested the package using an installation of [TexLive 2021](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), along with most recent updates available in late February 2022. It might be necessary to manually change one `make4ht` file for preprocessing `.rmd` files for output as `.odt`, since this change hasn't yet been distributed to the CTAN network; see the [February 28th commit](https://github.com/michal-h21/make4ht/commit/a7ed9e73948ce8fd9749e94bd84a7607cca07f9c) for details.

Once these are set up, please cross your fingers and proceed. Things work well on my Mac, but something will certainly go wrong on another system. The functions calling `make4ht` are particularly fragile: they pull together a simple bash command and send it to the system terminal. Who knows whether this will work on Windows?

# Three Output Formats

For most purposes, `mla_document` will be the most useful, and it is the option I recommend using. This format prepares a PDF document with MLA-style formatting for submitting for a class or for publication, when PDF documents are allowed. Resulting text is set in a 12-point serif font face, double-spaced, with running headers, appropriate margins, and [MLA-style citations](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-mla). As an alias to `mla_document`, `pdf_document` does exactly the same thing and is provided to make things easier for anyone with experience using R Markdown.

The second format is `latex_document`, which exposes the Latex code in the `.tex` file prepared before the above format. This Latex code is pretty kludgey, so the format is provided to help with troubleshooting.

Of the three, `word_document` is the least satisfying format. Font faces, sizes, spacing, and margins should be be fine, but the option does not prepare document headers or citations in the way the above options do. If you must prepare something in Microsoft Word format---and if you're writing in the humanities, you probably do---you're recommended instead to use the `create_odt` function with the `knit:` parameter in the header, described below.

# Exporting to Microsoft Word

A fourth output format is available using the `knit: rmd4mla::create_odt` parameter in the header. When you uncomment this line and knit the document, `rmd4mla` will prepare a file in the OpenDocument `.odt` file format, which can be opened by Microsoft Word. Although this is the recommended pathway for preparing work in Microsoft Word format because it formats the document and uses biblatex-mla for citations and the list of Works Cited, things are not perfect: the resulting file will lack running headers and page numbers, so you'll have to add these manually Additionally, my inelegant code means that the `.odt` file is a bit fragile, so please be sure to use the "Save as..." feature to export the file into `.docx` format.

If you're getting errors in this stage and are having trouble tracking them down, it might be helpful to use `knit: rmd4mla::create_odt_keep`, which will keep all files prepared during this step. (When working with a file called `example.rmd`, the typical behavior will be to delete every file in the project folder named `example.XXX` with a later modification date than the R Markdown file---excepting a few relevant extensions.)

# Header Settings
In addition to setting the document's title, author, date, and bibliography (of which more below), the R Markdown header adds some additional parameters. The `lastname` parameter defines a running header; if this option is not set, the package will print the title beside the page number. Additionally, for preparing a document as an assignment, there are options for including the name of a `professor` and the name of the `class`. If a manuscript is being prepared for publication, options are provided for `postal` address (bizarrely, only on one line?), `email` address, and `telephone` number. Finally, there are two logical toggles: one to format the document with a `titlepage` and a second to prepare the document for `anonymous` submission; the latter option creates a title page and changes the running header to the document title.

# Citations
Prepare Bibtex references and save them in a `.bib` file, and then reference this file in the document header. For instance, if your file is called `sources.bib` and it's in the same folder as your R Markdown file, your header will look like this: `bibliography: sources.bib`.

To reference a source use the Markdown format for referencing, which is enclosed in square brackets and uses the "@" sign and comma like this: `[@citekey, 34]`. Here's how a sample citation looks in practice [@Dostoevsky:1993wh, 34]. \nocite{*} Here, I'm also inputting Latex code to include hidden citations to all entries in the `.bib` file to demonstrate the functionality and check the formatting.
